## Introduction 

R is a programming language created and developed in 1991 by two statisticians at the University of Auckland, in New Zealand. It officially became free and open-source only in 1995. For its origins, it provides statistical and graphical techniques, linear and non-linear models, techniques for time series, and many other functionalities. Even if Python is the most common in the Data Science field, R is still widely used for specialized purposes, like in financial companies, research, and healthcare.

## Requirements to Learn R Programming

If you want to start programming in R, you need to install the last versions of R and R studio or use the cloud version - poitcloud. You are surely asking yourself why you need to install both. If you prefer, you can install only R and you will have a basic tool to write the code. In addition, R studio provides an intuitive and efficient graphical interface to write code in R. It allows to divide the interface into subwindows to visualize separately the code, the output of the variables, the plots, the environment, and many other features.

## Basics of R programming

> Assignment operation

> When we program in R, the entities we work with are called objects. They can be numbers, strings, vectors, matrices, arrays, or functions. So, any generic data structure is an object. The assignment operator is <- (or =), which combines the characters < and -. We can visualize the output of the object by calling it:

```{r}
x <- 23
x
```
